1. Multivariate Analysis project:This is an analysis of United Nations dataset about the GDP per capita, the life expectancy, and the population of 141 different countries from 1952 to 2007 at a five-year interval.
This dataset consists of multiple variables that are suitable for key multivariate analysis, dimension reduction, dimension scaling, correlation and regression analysis, discriminant analysis and clustering. The aim of this multivariate analysis is to to produce useful insights from three measurements, the GDP per capita, the life expectancy and the population size from the data set.
2. Statistical Analysis project: This is a statistical analysis for an ornithologist for the data collected on kittiwakes, a type of gull with two sub-species of kittiwake, black-legged and red-legged. The analysis consists of the exploratory data analysis from an observation point, over a 28day period, statistical inference based on the summary statistics of the observation data and determining the confidence interval from an observation time. Test of the hypothesis that the decline in kittiwake numbers over time is independent of site and an estimation for the number of breeding pairs at a site. This analysis covers checks for linear relationship, correlation, fitting linear models, check for dependence and drawing inference from multiple comparisons between the sub-species of the kittiwake.
