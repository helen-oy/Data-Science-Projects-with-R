1. Multivariate Analysis project:
**Project overview:** This is an analysis of United Nations dataset about the GDP per capita, the life expectancy, and the population of 141 different countries from 1952 to 2007 at a five-year interval.The goal was to explore patterns and relationships between these variables and how they changed over time. By examining this data, we aimed to uncover insights into economic growth, population trends, and their impact on life expectancy.
**Problem statement:**
Understanding the relationship between economic factors like GDP and social outcomes like life expectancy can be challenging with large datasets. Without proper analysis, it’s difficult to spot trends or make meaningful conclusions. This project sought to make sense of the data and reveal the hidden stories behind global and regional differences.
**Approach:** The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using R. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into trends and relationships, while visualizations helped compare life expectancy, GDP, and population changes over time. Advanced techniques like clustering, regression analysis, and PCA were used to identify patterns and predict outcomes.
**Result and Impact:**
1.The analysis showed Oceania had the highest life expectancy and GDP growth, while Africa experienced slower progress.
2. Clustering revealed three main groups of countries based on economic and demographic similarities.
3. Regression models highlighted a strong link between GDP and life expectancy, with log GDP providing the best predictive accuracy.

2. Statistical Data analysis
**Project overview:** This is a statistical analysis for an ornithologist for the data collected on kittiwakes, a type of gull with two sub-species of kittiwake, black-legged and red-legged. The analysis consists of the exploratory data analysis from an observation point, over a 28day period, statistical inference based on the summary statistics of the observation data and determining the confidence interval from an observation time. Test of the hypothesis that the decline in kittiwake numbers over time is independent of site and an estimation for the number of breeding pairs at a site. This analysis covers checks for linear relationship, correlation, fitting linear models, check for dependence and drawing inference from multiple comparisons between the sub-species of the kittiwake.
**Problem Statement:**
Kittiwake populations may be declining due to environmental changes and observation challenges. There’s a need to understand how these factors affect sightings, sub-species traits, and breeding success. Limited data and complex relationships make it difficult to predict trends and make informed decisions for their conservation.
**Approach:**
Analyzed the data using statistical methods like trend analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling. These tools helped identify patterns, compare traits between sub-species, and pinpoint factors influencing breeding success. The models were refined to improve predictions and highlight key insights.
**Results and Impact:**
The analysis revealed clear trends in sightings and notable differences between kittiwake sub-species. It also identified important environmental factors that influence breeding pairs, offering valuable predictions for specific locations. These findings provide practical insights to guide conservation and protect kittiwake populations.
